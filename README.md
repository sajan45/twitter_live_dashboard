# README

The tech stack:

* Ruby 2.6.3
* Rails 5.2.4
* SQLite (not used)
* Redis
* Twitter API
* ActionCable (for websocket)
* Needs JDK to run the Stanford NLP library (MacOS download link: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US)

## Starting instructions

* Start a Redis server in localhost `redis-server`
* Install git-lfs from https://git-lfs.github.com/
* Run `git lfs install` after git-lfs installation.
* Clone the Repo to a local directory `git clone https://github.com/sajan45/twitter_live_dashboard`. Please be patient as the repo is heavy due to NLP models.
* Run `cd twitter-live-dashboard`
* Run `rails server`

## Usage Instructions
* Open **http://localhost:3000/tweets/?source=%40timesofindia** for live stream of tweets of a user (timesofindia in this case)
* Open **http://localhost:3000/tweets/?source=%23SavdhaanIndia** to live stream tweets on a hashtag
* Open **http://localhost:3000/word-cloud** for a word-cloud of words from tweets related to Byjus
* Open **http://localhost:3000/sentiment** for sentiment analysis chart

## Architecture

The project uses Websocket connections to stream tweets to the browser. Every request to /tweets page opens a websocket connection and subscribes the user to a particular topic (either a user or a hashtag). During subscription, the server checks whether there are any other users who are also subscribed to the same topic. If there are no other users subscribed to the same topic, then the Channel starts a **Worker** which runs in s separate **thread** and keeps listening for new tweets on the given topic, using Twitter's stream API.  When there is a new tweet, it broadcasts that to all clients who are subscribed to that topic.

The server uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live streaming on REST API. Since by nature, SSE uses a blocking connection, I am using 'Rack hijack' API to take-over the connection and server it from a different Thread, so that it won't block the thread of the application server, hence freeing up the resource for other active users.

It uses Redis to store connection count related data.

We are using Stanford NLP for sentiment analysis if tweets. It gives a score between 0 to 4, where 0 = very negative, 1 = negative, 2 = neutral, 3 = positive, and 4 = very positive. While analysis the sentiment, we break the whole text to sentences and consider the sentiment of the longest sentence as the sentiment of the whole text.
